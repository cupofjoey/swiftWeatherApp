# swiftWeatherApp
A Rather Shoddy Weather App, but it Works for Now
* This was a weather app I did for my Udemy iOS 10 Dev Course
* I just want to say that I'm not really happy with it. He had us take a url and parse it, add xml keys to essentially whitelist the 
URL he wanted us to use, and then had us use the text field to inject the name of whatever town we're trying to find the weather for. 
* It's a bit weird, it gets really long in the tooth with 'if let' statements, and I'd much rather learn API's with Swift than going into
the XML of Info.plist and adding keys for websites. Teach us how to do the regex, you know?
* Anyway, it is what it is, and if you'd like to change anything, please feel free to do so.
